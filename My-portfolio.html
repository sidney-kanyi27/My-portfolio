    <h2>About me</h2>

    <p>My name is Sidney Kanyi.I am 20 years old,turning 21 on the 12th of May.I studied at Moi High School Kabarak where I attained a B+ upon completion.I then went to study Architecture abroad in Malaysia in Taylors University,which practically sucked
        the life out of me even though I was there for a short period of time.People ask me what I miss most about the country and I always answer, the night life,which was out of this world.I don't miss Architecture at all in other words.It was a pain
        in the keister.It was during that time that I developed an interest in programming,started some few online courses and I have not looked back ever since.
    </p>
    <p>I am especially interested in the security aspect of programming:cybersecurity.I would like to be an ethical hacker in the near future to enusre systems are protected at all times.Another reason I decided to delve into coding is to actualize my ideas
        once I have attained the necessary skill set to enable me to do just that.I also have my eyes set on blockchain technology and would like to have a firm grasp of what it entails and how I can manipulate it to my advantage.
    </p>
    <p>My hobbies are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>swimming</li>
        <li>playing guitar:I am the best guitarist you will ever meet might I add.It really gives me peace of mind and gets me luck with the ladies.Haha!</li>
    </ul>
